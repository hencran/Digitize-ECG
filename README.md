# Default Repository
Put a brief description of your code project here...
Lab members may use this template repository as a starting point for their projects. Every repository should contain this general file structure or something equally modular and organized. This template README outlines some important information that lab members should document as they create their projects. Lab members should consider adding more sections to provide instructions for each repository module.

# Repository Organization
## source
This folder contains the source code of the project. Different programming languages have different structures for source code. For example, MATLAB requires that all associated files be contained in the same parent directory. Object-oriented languages will have separate directories for unit tests and application code. R projects may be a single Rmarkdown file. Cater your source file to your project, and be organized.

## resources
The purpose of this folder varies wildly. It is typically meant for configuration files or image resources. A firmware project may use this folder to store files containing static memory data to be loaded to a microcontroller before program execution. If your project does not load static data from external files, this folder may be unnecessary.

## documents
This folder contains important datasheets, schematics, and other block diagrams that describe the overall project design. Projects with hardware designed here at SRL should use subfolders to separate third-party datasheets from our design documents.

# Instructions
Give new users instructions for using this repository.
